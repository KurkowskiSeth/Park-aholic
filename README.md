## Installation Instructions

There are no special instructions just yet for installing this project.

## Hardware Considerations and Requirements

If you wish to see real local parks, make sure you are running the application on a iOS device.

## Known Bugs

* The filter button segues to a blank view controller with no back botton.
* Pressing either the park cell in the table view or the pin on the map won’t take you anywhere.
* Both the user’s location and the park’s locations on the map are the same color so you won’t be able to tell them apart.
